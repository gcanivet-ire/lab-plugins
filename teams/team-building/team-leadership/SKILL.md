# Real Estate Team Leadership

Domain knowledge for real estate team leaders covering agent coaching, performance tracking, lead management, transaction oversight, and recruiting.

## Coaching Frameworks

### The 4-Part 1-on-1 Structure

Use this framework for weekly agent check-ins:

1. **Wins & Recognition** (5 min) — Start positive. Ask what went well. Celebrate closed deals, new listings, or personal growth.
2. **Numbers Review** (10 min) — Walk through the agent's KPIs vs. goals. Focus on leading indicators (calls, appointments, showings) not just lagging ones (closings).
3. **Skill Development** (10 min) — Identify one skill to sharpen this week. Role-play objection handling, listing presentations, or buyer consultations.
4. **Commitments** (5 min) — Agent states 2-3 specific commitments for the coming week with measurable outcomes.

### Accountability Conversation Model (ACE)

When an agent is underperforming:

- **Acknowledge** — State what you're observing without judgment. ("I've noticed your showing count dropped from 8 to 2 this month.")
- **Clarify** — Ask open questions to understand the root cause. ("What's getting in the way?")
- **Establish** — Co-create a specific recovery plan with daily/weekly milestones.

### Agent Development Tiers

Classify agents into tiers to tailor coaching:

| Tier | Production | Coaching Focus |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| New (0-6 mo) | 0-3 transactions | Lead follow-up habits, scripts, time blocking, shadowing |
| Developing (6-18 mo) | 4-12 transactions/yr | Conversion skills, listing presentations, negotiation |
| Producing (18+ mo) | 12-24 transactions/yr | Efficiency, leverage, team building, SOI cultivation |
| Top Producer | 24+ transactions/yr | Business planning, delegation, brand building, mentoring |

## Performance Metrics & Benchmarks

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Track these metrics per agent, per team, and over time:

**Leading Indicators (Activity)**
- Outbound contacts per day (target: 20-25 for full-time agents)
- Appointments set per week (target: 3-5)
- Showings conducted per week
- Listing presentations per month
- Open houses held per month

**Conversion Benchmarks**
- Lead to appointment: 3-5% (internet leads), 15-25% (sphere/referral)
- Appointment to signed agreement: 40-60%
- Listing to sold: 85-95%
- Showing to offer: 8-12 showings per offer (buyers)
- Under contract to closed: 85-92%

**Lagging Indicators (Results)**
- Units closed (monthly / quarterly / annual)
- Total sales volume
- Gross commission income (GCI)
- Average sale price
- Average days on market (listings)
- List-to-sale price ratio

### Team Health Metrics

- Agent retention rate (target: >80% annually)
- Average ramp time for new agents (target: <90 days to first closing)
- Lead response time (target: <5 minutes for new internet leads)
- Pipeline coverage ratio: total pipeline value / quarterly goal (target: 3:1)

## Lead Management

### Lead Distribution Rules

Distribute leads based on these criteria (in priority order):

1. **Speed to lead** — Route to the first available agent who can respond within 5 minutes
2. **Specialization match** — Match lead type (buyer/seller, price range, area) to agent expertise
3. **Capacity** — Don't overload agents; check active lead count vs. capacity
4. **Round-robin fallback** — If no specialization match, distribute evenly by rotation

### Lead Follow-Up Cadence

| Lead Type | Day 1 | Day 2-3 | Day 4-7 | Day 8-30 | Day 30+ |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| New internet lead | 5 calls + text + email | 2 calls + email | 1 call/day | 2x/week | 1x/week for 90 days |
| Referral | Call within 1 hour | Follow-up call | Appointment attempt | Weekly touch | Monthly |
| Past client | Personal call | Handwritten note | CMA or market update | Quarterly | Quarterly |

## Transaction Oversight

### Pipeline Review Checklist

During weekly pipeline reviews, check each active deal for:

- Contract deadlines approaching (inspection, appraisal, financing, closing)
- Missing documents or signatures
- Commission disputes or split issues
- Client communication gaps (>48 hours since last agent-client contact)
- Price reductions needed (listings on market >21 days with <3 showings/week)

### Risk Flags

Flag transactions that meet any of these criteria:

- Closing date within 14 days and financing not yet approved
- Inspection period ending within 48 hours with no resolution
- Agent has not logged client contact in >5 days
- Contract amendments pending >72 hours without response

## Recruiting & Onboarding

### Recruiting Pipeline Stages

1. **Identified** — Potential recruit found (competing brokerage, new licensee, referral)
2. **Initial Contact** — First conversation or coffee meeting
3. **Presentation** — Formal value proposition / compensation presentation
4. **Negotiation** — Discussing terms, splits, support
5. **Committed** — Verbal agreement, pending paperwork
6. **Onboarded** — Signed, systems set up, training started

### 90-Day Onboarding Milestones

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Systems access, CRM setup, email/phone configured, announce to team |
| 2 | Complete core training modules, shadow 2 listing appointments |
| 3 | Begin lead follow-up with live leads, first open house |
| 4 | First buyer consultation (solo), 1-on-1 coaching established |
| 6 | First listing appointment (solo), pipeline building cadence active |
| 8 | At least 1 active client under agreement |
| 12 | First transaction closed or under contract, self-sufficient on core systems |
