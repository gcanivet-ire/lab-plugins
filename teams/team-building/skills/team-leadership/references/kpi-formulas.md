# KPI Calculation Formulas

Standard formulas for calculating real estate team performance metrics.

## Conversion Rate Formulas

### Lead to Appointment Rate
```
(Appointments Set / Total Leads Received) x 100
```
Measure per lead source for meaningful comparison. Internet leads typically convert at 3-5%, sphere/referral at 15-25%.

### Appointment to Contract Rate
```
(Signed Agreements / Total Appointments) x 100
```
Target: 40-60%. Below 40% indicates skill gap in consultations or listing presentations.

### Contract to Close Rate
```
(Closed Transactions / Signed Contracts) x 100
```
Target: 85-92%. Below 85% may indicate issues with pre-qualification, inspection negotiation, or financing contingencies.

### Overall Lead Conversion Rate
```
(Closed Transactions / Total Leads) x 100
```
Combine all stages. Typical range: 1-3% for internet leads, 8-15% for referral leads.

## Production Formulas

### Gross Commission Income (GCI)
```
Sum of (Sale Price x Commission Rate) for all closed transactions
```

### Per-Agent GCI
```
Total Team GCI / Number of Producing Agents
```

### Revenue Per Lead
```
Total GCI / Total Leads Received
```
Use this to evaluate lead source ROI.

### Cost Per Acquisition
```
(Marketing Spend + Lead Cost) / Closed Transactions from That Source
```

## Activity Efficiency

### Contacts Per Closing
```
Total Outbound Contacts / Closings in Same Period
```
Helps agents understand the activity volume required to hit goals.

### Showings Per Offer
```
Total Showings / Offers Written
```
Benchmark: 8-12 showings per offer for buyers. Higher may indicate agent not qualifying buyers well.

### Days on Market (DOM) vs. Market Average
```
Agent Average DOM - Market Average DOM
```
Negative = agent is outperforming market. Positive = pricing or marketing issues.

### List-to-Sale Price Ratio
```
(Final Sale Price / Original List Price) x 100
```
Target: 96-100%. Below 95% may indicate overpricing at listing.

## Team Health

### Agent Retention Rate
```
(Agents at End of Period - New Hires During Period) / Agents at Start of Period x 100
```

### Ramp Time
```
Days from Onboarding Start to First Closing
```
Track per agent and as a team average. Target: <90 days.

### Pipeline Coverage Ratio
```
Total Active Pipeline Value / Quarterly GCI Goal
```
Target: 3:1 or higher. Below 2:1 is a warning sign for the quarter.

### Lead Response Time
```
Median time from lead receipt to first agent contact attempt
```
Target: <5 minutes. Measure by lead source and by agent.

## Speed Metrics

### Average Time to Contract (Buyers)
```
Average days from first showing to accepted offer
```

### Average Time to Contract (Listings)
```
Average days from listing active to accepted offer
```

### Transaction Cycle Time
```
Average days from contract to close
```
Use to forecast closing dates and cash flow.
