# Lepage Johnson Brand Guidelines (Asset-Derived)

This guideline is derived from assets in:
- `assets-lepagejohnson/Logo+EXP_blk.svg`
- `assets-lepagejohnson/Logo+EXP_blk.png`
- `assets-lepagejohnson/Logo+EXP_blk.pdf`

Use this as the authoritative style reference for brand id: `lepagejohnson`.

## Brand Identity

- **Brand id**: `lepagejohnson`
- **Display name**: Lepage Johnson
- **Aliases to recognize**: `lepage johnson`, `lepage-johnson`, `lj`

## Verified Brand Assets

- Primary logo (vector): `assets-lepagejohnson/Logo+EXP_blk.svg`
- Primary logo (raster): `assets-lepagejohnson/Logo+EXP_blk.png`
- Primary logo (print): `assets-lepagejohnson/Logo+EXP_blk.pdf`

## Logo Rules (Strict)

1. Use only the provided official logo files.
2. Do not recolor, redraw, crop, outline, stretch, rotate, or add effects.
3. Preserve original logo aspect ratio.
4. Use black logo on light backgrounds for maximum contrast.
5. If background contrast is questionable, move logo to a white panel/block.
6. Keep clear space around logo equal to at least 0.25x logo height on all sides.
7. Do not place text or graphics inside logo clear-space.

## Verified Color Usage

Only the following colors are verified from supplied assets:

- **Black**: `#000000`
- **White**: `#FFFFFF`

If additional brand colors are needed, ask the user before using them.

## Typography Guidance

Exact brand typefaces are not explicitly defined in the supplied files.

Until the user provides approved font specs:
- Use a clean, professional layout.
- Keep headings and body highly legible.
- Avoid decorative/script fonts.
- Do not claim a specific proprietary font family.

## Tone and Writing Style for Deliverables

- Professional, confident, and concise.
- Data-first and client-facing.
- Avoid hype language and avoid slang.
- Prefer clear sectioning, short paragraphs, and scannable bullets/tables.

## CMA and Listing Asset Formatting Guidance

For CMA and similar reports:
- Lead with summary and pricing recommendation.
- Use clear comp tables with consistent columns.
- Separate facts from assumptions.
- Include confidence level and caveats.
- Keep visual style minimal and high-contrast.
- Use logo once in header or cover unless user asks for more branding.

## Brand Selection Safety Rule (Required)

When generating any asset:

1. Determine target brand from explicit user input first.
2. If not explicit, infer from conversation/project context.
3. If still ambiguous or conflicting, ask:
   - "Which brand should I use for this asset?"
4. Do not finalize branded output until brand is confirmed.

## Compliance Checklist

Before finalizing any branded asset, verify:

- [ ] Brand selected and confirmed
- [ ] Official Lepage Johnson logo file used
- [ ] Logo unmodified and clear-space respected
- [ ] Only verified colors used (or user-approved override)
- [ ] Tone is professional and concise
- [ ] Document includes assumptions/caveats where needed

## Known Gaps / Recommended Next Inputs

To strengthen brand accuracy, request from user:
- Approved font stack
- Secondary color palette (if any)
- Cover/page templates
- Footer/disclaimer rules
- Photography/icon style rules
