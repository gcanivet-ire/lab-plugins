# Elysian Brand Guidelines (Asset-Derived)

This guideline is derived from assets in:
- `assets-elysian/elysian-buyer-packet.pdf`
- `assets-elysian/elysian-seller-packet.pdf`

Use this as the authoritative style reference for brand id: `elysian`.

## Brand Identity

- **Brand id**: `elysian`
- **Display name**: Elysian Homes
- **Observed handles/domain**:
  - `elysianhomesny.com`
  - `@elysianhomesny`
- **Aliases to recognize**: `elysian`, `elysian homes`, `elysian homes ny`

## Brand Positioning (Observed Voice)

From the buyer and seller packets, Elysian voice is:
- service-first and supportive
- practical and educational
- local-market knowledgeable
- confidence-building without hard-sell language

Use a tone that is:
- warm but professional
- clear and direct
- process-oriented and reassuring

## Content Style Patterns to Reuse

The provided packets consistently use:

1. **Structured journey sections**
   - timeline/process steps
   - what to expect next
   - checklists

2. **Client education blocks**
   - definitions (common terms)
   - decision factors (pricing, offers, negotiations)
   - practical tips and caveats

3. **Local expertise framing**
   - Rochester-specific neighborhood and market context
   - local lender/partner emphasis

4. **Trust and commitment language**
   - loyalty, disclosure, confidentiality, accountability
   - strong emphasis on guidance and follow-through

## Visual/Design Rules (Conservative by Evidence)

Exact color palette and typography specs are not explicitly extractable from PDF text alone.
Until explicit specs are provided:

- Keep layouts clean, modern, and highly legible.
- Prefer high-contrast text/background combinations.
- Use consistent heading hierarchy and section spacing.
- Avoid decorative fonts or excessive styling.
- Keep tables simple and readable for print and digital.

If brand color or font selection is uncertain, ask the user before finalizing output.

## Logo and Media Usage

No standalone logo asset is currently present in `assets-elysian` (packets only).

Rules:
- Do not invent or recreate a logo.
- If a logo is required in output, ask user to provide approved Elysian logo files.
- If unavailable, proceed with text-based branding ("Elysian Homes") and note the limitation.

## CMA and Listing Asset Guidance for Elysian

For CMA and similar client deliverables:
- Lead with recommendation summary and confidence level.
- Include seller/buyer-friendly explanations, not just metrics.
- Keep assumptions transparent.
- Tie valuation to local comps and current market trends.
- Include practical next steps and decision guidance.

## Required Brand Selection Safety Rule

Before creating any branded asset:

1. Determine brand from explicit user instruction first.
2. If not explicit, infer from context.
3. If still ambiguous or conflicting, ask:
   - "Which brand should I use for this asset?"
4. Do not finalize branded output until brand is confirmed.
